# **CYTOPATH MASTER — OPTIMIZED MASTER PROMPT FOR EDUCATIONAL APP GENERATION**

A fully comprehensive, **mobile-first**, **dark-mode**, **offline-ready** educational platform designed to teach **cytology/cytopathology** exactly as a **pathology resident** would learn it during a **cytology rotation**, including:

- Exfoliative cytology (Pap smears, urine, effusions, sputum, brushings/washings)  
- Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology (thyroid, lymph node, salivary gland, soft tissue, breast, pancreas)  
- Ancillary studies (IHC, flow cytometry, molecular)  
- Screening principles (Bethesda, Paris, Milan, Sydney systems)  
- Cell morphology, background patterns, and key diagnostic pitfalls  
- Adequacy assessment & rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) logic  
- Infection-related cytology  
- Artifacts vs true pathology  
- Integration with histology and radiologic correlation  

This app must emphasize **pattern recognition**, **practical workflows**, **classification systems**, and **integrated diagnostic reasoning**—the exact thinking expected of a cytology trainee.

All examples must be **synthetic**, **icon-based**, and **textual**, not real images.

Assessments are **session-only** with **no tracking**.

- **FNA Navigator** — “From smear → pattern → diagnosis.”  

**Success Criteria:**  
- Learners can classify cytology specimens using the correct system.  
- Users understand when to call a specimen “non-diagnostic.”  
- Residents can identify major malignant vs benign patterns.  
- Trainees can integrate morphology + IHC + molecular + clinical data.

# **3. PERSONAS & USE CASES**

### PERSONAS
1. **PGY-2/3 Pathology Resident**  
   - Pain: Cytology feels abstract and pattern-heavy.  
   - Goal: Build strong pattern recognition & category classification.

2. **Cytopath Fellow**  
   - Pain: Integrating morphology with ancillary tests.  
   - Goal: Confidently classifying edge cases.

3. **MS4 on Path Elective**  
   - Pain: Doesn’t know how to approach a cytology slide.  
   - Goal: Learn “cytology logic” stepwise.

### USE CASES
- “Is this specimen adequate?”  
- “Which classification system applies here?”  
- “Is this high-grade, low-grade, atypical, or benign?”  
- “Is this lymphoid population reactive or neoplastic?”  
- “Should I recommend ancillary tests?”  
- “How does this correlate with histology?”
